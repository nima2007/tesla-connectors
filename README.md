# Tesla Connector Search Tool

This project consists of two main Python scripts:

1.  `scrape_tesla_connectors.py`: A web scraper that collects connector data from the Tesla service website and saves it to `connectors.json`.
2.  `app.py`: A Streamlit web application that allows users to search and filter through the collected connector data.

## Features

### Scraper (`scrape_tesla_connectors.py`)
- Fetches connector details from the Tesla Model 3 Electrical Reference.
- Parses information such as part numbers, connector type, color, pinouts, and image URLs.
- Saves the scraped data into `connectors.json`.

### Search App (`app.py`)
- Provides a user-friendly interface to search for connectors.
- Filtering options include:
    - Total number of cavities.
    - Number of unconnected cavities.
    - Manufacturer (prefix match).
    - Tesla Part Number (contains match).
    - Connector Part Number (contains match from the 'connector' field).
    - Connector body color.
    - Specific wire color in a specific cavity.
    - Exact count of a specific wire color across all cavities.
- Displays results in a sortable table.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the files):**
    ```bash
    # If you have git installed
    # git clone <repository_url>
    # cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    # venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    # source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### 1. Scrape Connector Data (Optional if `connectors.json` is already present and up-to-date)

To update or generate the `connectors.json` data file, run the scraper:
```bash
python scrape_tesla_connectors.py
```
This script will fetch the latest connector information and save it to `connectors.json`. This might take some time depending on your internet connection and the number of connectors.

**Note:** The `CONNECTOR_LIMIT` variable in `scrape_tesla_connectors.py` can be set to an integer to limit the number of connectors scraped during testing (e.g., `CONNECTOR_LIMIT = 10`). Set it to `None` to scrape all connectors.

### 2. Run the Connector Search App

Once you have the `connectors.json` file (either by running the scraper or by using the one included in the repository), you can start the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
This will open the search tool in your web browser.
